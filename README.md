This site is a tutorial to help in learning rails.
=======================================

This is a website that is supposed to be very similar to tumblr. 


This is my follow-along website to go with a skill share tutorial found at this url.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn rails.  Tal Safran doesn't just teach you how to make something work but he makes it pretty as well which is more satisfying than some others that I've found.  If you're interested follow this  [link](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/technology/Ruby-on-Rails-in-30-Days-Build-Your-First-Web-App/2136222497) to the website.

### Critique of the Tutorial

While this is my favorite tutorial for rails I've found, Tal's speed is so blistering fast that it requires you to stop the video, rewind and repeat many times to follow along.  I would say it generally takes me 1.5 - 2 times the length of the video to be able to grasp it all and follow along.
